# Indian EV Market Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to deploy a Streamlit web app, showcasing a comprehensive dashboard for Electronic Vehicle (EV) analysis. The dashboard is designed to highlight EV market trends and descriptions using interactive charts and plots.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create a robust web application that provides meaningful insights into the EV market, leveraging Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Streamlit.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a diverse dataset, comprising:

* **EV Maker by Place**: A list of popular EV manufacturers and their manufacturing plant locations.
* **Operational PC**: Total operational public charging stations for EVs available in each state.
* **Vehicle Class**: Total vehicles (including electric and other fuels) registered (manufactured) by category from 2001 to August 2024.
* **ev_cat_01-24**: Total electric vehicles manufactured from 2001 to August 2024, categorized by vehicle type.
* **ev_sales_by_makers_and_cat_15-24**: Total electric vehicles manufactured by makers from 2015 to August 2024, categorized by vehicle class.

## Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
2. **EDA**: Perform exploratory data analysis to extract insights from the data.
3. **Streamlit Web App**: Create a web application using Streamlit to showcase the insights using interactive charts and plots.

## Results

The dashboard on the web app provides meaningful insights, including:

* EV trends over the years
* Required vehicle counts
* EV supply in all categories
* And many more
